# Demo code for the wlBurst v2 library

## Overview

This is demo code intended to be used with the wlBurst v2 library.

This project includes the development tree for the demo; the demo itself
will ideally be packaged as a sample code folder within the wlBurst v2
project.

## Documentation

For now, see the README.md file in the demo code folder for documentation.

The user manual and library reference in the wlBurst v2 project are also
recommended reading.

## Folders

**FIXME** Folder list goes here.

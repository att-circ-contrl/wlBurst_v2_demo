# Demo code for the wlBurst v2 library

## Overview

This is demo code intended to be used with the wlBurst v2 library.

This project includes the development tree for the demo; the demo itself
will ideally be packaged as a sample code folder within the wlBurst v2
project.

## Documentation

For now, see the README.md file in the demo code folder for documentation.

The user manual and library reference in the wlBurst v2 project are also
recommended reading.

## Folders

* 'datasets-cooked' --
Field Trip data intended to be used by the demo script.
* 'datasets-raw' --
Datasets from which the "cooked" datasets were derived.
* 'development' --
Scripts that are not intended to be part of the demo.

**FIXME** -- Demo script folder to-do.
